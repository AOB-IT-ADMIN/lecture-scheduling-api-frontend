// jest-dom adds custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// It enhances Jest's capabilities when working with the DOM in testing.
// With these custom matchers, you can perform assertions like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
// For more details and examples, refer to the official documentation:
// https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom
